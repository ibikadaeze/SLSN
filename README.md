This is a code for analytical modelling of shock waves slamming into a circumstella material thereby giving off synchrotron emission. Free-free absorption and synchrotron self-absorption can also take place in this scenario. SO, the code accounts for those as well to produce SED at radio frequencies at different epochs. The local environmental properties such as radius, density, magnetic field strength, are alswo estimated with this code.
