;;updated using information from Katsuda+2014 (1-6 years after explosion with Swift)
;;They find that the spectra taken 2-3 years after the explosion are heavily absorbed, but that this gradually decreases after.
;;They interpret this in the idea that it exploded in a dense CSM, but that the shock has overtaken itâ€¦
;;The intrinsic luminosity stays constant until the final epoch when it falls by a factor of 2.
;;I might want to examine the observed flux for these, or only the unabsorbed luminosity or something:
;;Here I list the UNABSORBED flux:
